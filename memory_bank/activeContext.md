# Active Context: ColorAgent

## Current Focus

The project has progressed from initial planning to implementation phase. We have successfully implemented the backend API for the ColorAgent project, which provides data on vendors of acrylic paint products.

## Recent Changes

-   Created the Memory Bank structure with core files:

    -   projectbrief.md: Defined the project scope and core requirements
    -   productContext.md: Documented the problem statement, user personas, and key features
    -   systemPatterns.md: Outlined the system architecture and design patterns
    -   techContext.md: Specified the technology stack and development environment
    -   activeContext.md (this file): Tracking current focus and next steps
    -   progress.md: Will track project progress and status

-   Implemented the backend API:
    -   Created SQLAlchemy models for all entities: Vendor, ProductLine, Product, ProductSwatch, ProductVariant, Locale
    -   Implemented supporting models for relationships: ProductType, ColorRange, Tag, Analogous, VendorColorRange, VendorProductType
    -   Set up proper relationships between models with appropriate cascade behavior
    -   Used SQLAlchemy's mapped_column for modern type annotations
    -   Implemented many-to-many relationships using association tables
    -   Created scripts for database initialization and data import
    -   Set up proper configuration with environment variable support
    -   Implemented async database operations with SQLAlchemy and asyncpg

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **API Completion**

    - Implement Pydantic schemas for all models
    - Create CRUD routes for all entities
    - Add filtering capabilities for search endpoints
    - Add comprehensive tests for API endpoints

2. **Frontend Development**

    - Create design system and component library
    - Implement basic navigation structure
    - Set up state management
    - Develop authentication flows

3. **Integration**
    - Connect frontend to backend API
    - Implement data fetching and caching
    - Add error handling and loading states

### Technical Decisions Pending

-   Specific color analysis and matching algorithms
-   Data scraping approach for paint product information
-   Image processing pipeline for color extraction
-   Caching strategy for performance optimization
-   Specific third-party services for authentication, storage, etc.

## Active Considerations

### User Experience

-   Ensuring the color comparison interface is intuitive and accurate
-   Balancing feature richness with simplicity for casual users
-   Designing an effective onboarding process for new users
-   Optimizing mobile experience for in-store paint shopping

### Technical Challenges

-   Accurate color representation across different devices and screens
-   Efficient color matching algorithms that consider various properties
-   Data synchronization between online and offline usage
-   Performance optimization for large paint collections
-   Scalable architecture for growing user base and data

### Business Considerations

-   Potential monetization strategies (subscription, freemium, etc.)
-   Partnership opportunities with paint manufacturers
-   Community building and user engagement
-   Data privacy and compliance with regulations

## Key Insights and Learnings

-   SQLAlchemy 2.0 with its new typing system provides a more robust way to define database models
-   Using TYPE_CHECKING for circular imports is essential for maintaining proper type hints
-   Async database operations with SQLAlchemy and asyncpg provide better performance for I/O-bound operations
-   Structuring the API with clear separation of concerns (models, schemas, routes) improves maintainability

## Communication Channels

-   GitHub Issues for task tracking
-   Pull Requests for code reviews
-   Team meetings scheduled weekly
-   Documentation updates in the Memory Bank

## Current Blockers

-   None identified at this stage

## Recent Decisions

-   Adopted Memory Bank approach for comprehensive documentation
-   Selected technology stack based on team expertise and project requirements
-   Prioritized mobile-first development approach given the use case of in-store paint shopping
-   Decided to use Turborepo with the `with-react-native-web` template for monorepo management
-   Selected Zustand over Redux for state management
-   Chose to build custom UI components using Shopify's Restyle library in a shared packages/ui package
-   Determined that no external object storage is needed; JSON files will be stored locally within the application
-   Decided to display colors sampled from images in custom SVG components rather than storing the images
-   Implemented SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships for the paint product data
-   Used asyncpg for async database operations
-   Created scripts for database initialization and data import
