# Active Context: ColorAgent

## Current Focus

The project is in its initial planning and setup phase. We are establishing the Memory Bank documentation to ensure continuity and clarity throughout the development process. This documentation will serve as the source of truth for the project's requirements, architecture, and progress.

## Recent Changes

- Created the Memory Bank structure with core files:
  - projectbrief.md: Defined the project scope and core requirements
  - productContext.md: Documented the problem statement, user personas, and key features
  - systemPatterns.md: Outlined the system architecture and design patterns
  - techContext.md: Specified the technology stack and development environment
  - activeContext.md (this file): Tracking current focus and next steps
  - progress.md: Will track project progress and status

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize the repository structure
   - Set up the development environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines
   - Establish coding standards and linting rules

2. **Core Architecture Implementation**
   - Implement the database schema
   - Create the basic API structure
   - Set up authentication system
   - Develop the data access layer

3. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Create design system and component library
   - Implement basic navigation structure
   - Set up state management
   - Develop authentication flows

### Technical Decisions Pending

- Specific color analysis and matching algorithms
- Data scraping approach for paint product information
- Image processing pipeline for color extraction
- Caching strategy for performance optimization
- Specific third-party services for authentication, storage, etc.

## Active Considerations

### User Experience
- Ensuring the color comparison interface is intuitive and accurate
- Balancing feature richness with simplicity for casual users
- Designing an effective onboarding process for new users
- Optimizing mobile experience for in-store paint shopping

### Technical Challenges
- Accurate color representation across different devices and screens
- Efficient color matching algorithms that consider various properties
- Data synchronization between online and offline usage
- Performance optimization for large paint collections
- Scalable architecture for growing user base and data

### Business Considerations
- Potential monetization strategies (subscription, freemium, etc.)
- Partnership opportunities with paint manufacturers
- Community building and user engagement
- Data privacy and compliance with regulations

## Key Insights and Learnings

As this is the initial setup phase, we are establishing the foundation for the project. Key insights will be documented here as development progresses.

## Communication Channels

- GitHub Issues for task tracking
- Pull Requests for code reviews
- Team meetings scheduled weekly
- Documentation updates in the Memory Bank

## Current Blockers

- None identified at this initial stage

## Recent Decisions

- Adopted Memory Bank approach for comprehensive documentation
- Selected technology stack based on team expertise and project requirements
- Prioritized mobile-first development approach given the use case of in-store paint shopping
- Decided to use Turborepo with the `with-react-native-web` template for monorepo management
- Selected Zustand over Redux for state management
- Chose to build custom UI components using Shopify's Restyle library in a shared packages/ui package
- Determined that no external object storage is needed; JSON files will be stored locally within the application
- Decided to display colors sampled from images in custom SVG components rather than storing the images
