# Progress Tracking: ColorAgent

## Project Status: Initial Planning Phase

The ColorAgent project is currently in the initial planning and documentation phase. We are establishing the foundation for development by creating comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Completed Items

### Documentation
- âœ… Project Brief: Defined core requirements and goals
- âœ… Product Context: Documented problem statement, user personas, and key features
- âœ… System Patterns: Outlined architecture and design patterns
- âœ… Technical Context: Specified technology stack and constraints
- âœ… Active Context: Established current focus and next steps
- âœ… Progress Tracking: Created this document to track progress

## In Progress

## Known Issues

No issues identified yet as development has not started.

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions
- Decision to use Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation
- Mobile-first approach prioritized due to in-store usage scenarios
- Modular architecture to allow for future expansion
- Adoption of Turborepo with React Native Web for cross-platform development
- Selection of Zustand for state management over Redux
- Decision to build custom UI components with Shopify's Restyle
- Decision to use local storage for JSON files instead of external object storage
- Approach to display colors in custom SVG components rather than storing images

### Pivots and Changes
None yet as the project is in initial planning.

## Metrics and KPIs

Will be tracked once development begins:
- Development velocity
- Test coverage
- Bug count and resolution time
- Feature completion percentage

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Accurate color representation across devices | High | High | Research color calibration techniques, implement device-specific adjustments |
| Data scraping challenges | Medium | Medium | Develop multiple approaches, consider partnerships with manufacturers |
| Performance with large paint collections | High | Medium | Implement efficient indexing, pagination, and caching strategies |
| User adoption | High | Medium | Focus on intuitive UX, gather early feedback, implement onboarding |
| Mobile-web feature parity | Medium | Low | Design with shared capabilities in mind, use cross-platform technologies |

## Retrospective Notes

Will be added as development progresses.
