## Known Issues

-   Need to implement proper error handling in API routes
-   Need to add validation for input data in API endpoints
-   Need to implement pagination for list endpoints

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions

-   Decision to use Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation
-   Mobile-first approach prioritized due to in-store usage scenarios
-   Modular architecture to allow for future expansion
-   Adoption of Turborepo with React Native Web for cross-platform development
-   Selection of Zustand for state management over Redux
-   Decision to build custom UI components with Shopify's Restyle
-   Decision to use local storage for JSON files instead of external object storage
-   Approach to display colors in custom SVG components rather than storing images
-   Implementation of SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships for the paint product data
-   Use of asyncpg for async database operations
-   Creation of scripts for database initialization and data import

### Pivots and Changes

-   Updated database schema to better represent the paint product data
-   Added support for multiple locales and currencies
-   Enhanced the product variant model to include more detailed information

## Metrics and KPIs

Now tracking:

-   Database model coverage: 100% of required entities implemented
-   API endpoint implementation: 0% (in progress)
-   Test coverage: 0% (to be implemented)

## Retrospective Notes

### Backend Implementation

-   SQLAlchemy 2.0's new typing system provides a more robust way to define database models
-   Using TYPE_CHECKING for circular imports is essential for maintaining proper type hints
-   Async database operations with SQLAlchemy and asyncpg provide better performance for I/O-bound operations
-   Structuring the API with clear separation of concerns (models, schemas, routes) improves maintainability
