# Product Context: ColorAgent

## Problem Statement

Miniature painting hobbyists face several challenges when working with paints:

1. **Paint Equivalency**: When a specific paint is unavailable or discontinued, finding an equivalent color from another brand is difficult and time-consuming.

2. **Collection Management**: Hobbyists accumulate large collections of paints but struggle to track what they own, what they need, and how colors relate to each other.

3. **Color Scheme Planning**: Planning color schemes for miniature projects requires visualizing combinations and ensuring necessary paints are available.

4. **Information Fragmentation**: Paint information is scattered across manufacturer websites, forums, and YouTube videos with inconsistent terminology and presentation.
