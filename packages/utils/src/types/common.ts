/**

 * While currently `[object AsyncFunction]` is returned when examining
 * the constructor of an async function. The actual object type is
 * really just `Function`. AsyncFunction is not an actual global object
 * that can be referenced. For the sake of type checking here, we'll
 * safely make AsyncFunction a real boy and guard against a possible
 * future where it really exists.
 *
 * @example
 * async function getProducts() {

/**
 * Allows creating a union type by combining primitive types and literal types without
 * sacrificing auto-completion in IDEs for the literal type part of the union.
 *
 * Currently, when a union type of a primitive type is combined with literal types,
 * TypeScript loses all information about the combined literals. Thus, when such type
 * is used in an IDE with autocompletion, no suggestions are made for the declared literals.
 *
 * This type is a workaround for [Microsoft/TypeScript#29729](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729).
 * It will be removed as soon as it's not needed anymore.
 *
 * NOTE: Taken from `type-fest`, which doesn't publicly export the utility...
 * out of spite, I bet ðŸ˜ 
 *
 * Use-cases:
 * - Get string keys from a type which may have number keys.
 * - Makes it possible to index using strings retrieved from template types.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const colors = [
 *     'blue',
 *     'red',
 *     'green',
 * ] as const
 *
 * type Color = (typeof colors)[number]
 *
 * const colorSet = new Set<Color>(colors)
 * const hasBlue = colorSet.has('blue')
 * \// 'blue' will be flagged as error in VS Code
 *
 * const colorSet = new Set<LiteralStringUnion<Color>>(colors)
 * const hasBlue = colorSet.has('blue')
 * \// 'blue' will no longer be flagged
 * ```
