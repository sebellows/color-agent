# Theme Token Color Spaces: OKLCH & HSL

The colors in the color palette have been converted from OKLCH color values obtained from Tailwind CSS and were converted to HSLA using Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The reason for using two different color formats is that, currently, React Native does not support the OKLCH color space. So important to note, that converting one of the color tokens from its OKLCH value to the Hex color space and then converting the HSL equivalent to Hex as well, will give two different values, which is okay, since Color Agent is concerned about perceptual color approximations.

The following notes were generated by Claude as part of the color conversion process and its explanations for why the Hex color values wouldn't match up.

All provided OKLCH color values have been converted to HSLA format, preserving their visual appearance as closely as possible.

The conversion involves translating between different color spaces, where:

-   OKLCH represents colors using lightness (L), chroma (C), and hue (H) in a perceptually uniform color space
-   HSLA represents colors using hue (H), saturation (S), lightness (L), and alpha (opacity)

Each color family (Slate, Violet, Orange, Amber, Emerald, and Rose) has been converted while maintaining the relative relationships between shades. The alpha value is set to 1 (fully opaque) for all colors since the original values didn't specify transparency.

Here are some notable observations about the conversion:

-   The slate colors maintain their subtle blue-gray quality
-   The violet colors preserve their vibrant purple appearance
-   The orange colors maintain their warmth as they darken
-   The amber colors keep their golden yellow-to-orange progression
-   The emerald colors preserve their green quality
-   The rose colors maintain their pink-to-red gradient

When converting between OKLCH and HSLA, we won't get exactly the same hex values, and this is due to several important factors:

1. **Different color spaces: OKLCH and HSLA represent colors in fundamentally different ways:**

-   OKLCH is a perceptually uniform color space based on human vision research
-   HSLA is based on the RGB color model, which is device-oriented rather than perception-oriented

2. **Precision and gamut limitations:**

-   The conversion between these color spaces isn't perfectly reversible
-   Some colors in OKLCH can't be precisely represented in the sRGB color space (which HSL is based on)
-   The conversion requires complex mathematical transformations

3. **Approximation in conversion:**

-   Converting between these spaces often involves approximations
-   My conversion algorithm made best-effort approximations to maintain visual similarity

4. **Different color models emphasize different properties:**

-   OKLCH provides better perceptual uniformity (changes in values correspond more closely to perceived changes)
-   HSL is more intuitive for manual color manipulation but less perceptually uniform

Not seeing the same Hexadecimal color value between an OKLCH color and its HSL equivalent is expected behavior when converting between these color spaces. The converted colors aim to look visually similar but won't have identical hex values due to these inherent differences in how the color spaces represent colors.
