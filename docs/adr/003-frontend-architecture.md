# ADR-003: Frontend Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design a frontend architecture for the ColorAgent application that allows us to:

- Share code between web and mobile platforms
- Maintain a consistent user experience across platforms
- Efficiently manage state and data fetching
- Ensure type safety and maintainability
- Support both web and mobile-specific features

## Decision

We will use React Native Web as our frontend framework with the following architecture:

1. **Framework**: 
   - React Native for mobile
   - Next.js with React Native Web for web
   
2. **State Management**:
   - Zustand for global state management
   - Tanstack Query for server state management and data fetching
   
3. **UI Components**:
   - Shared UI component library in the `packages/ui` workspace
   - Custom styling system based on Shopify's Restyle
   
4. **Type Safety**:
   - TypeScript for all frontend code
   - Shared TypeScript configurations in the `packages/typescript-config` workspace
   
5. **Architecture Pattern**:
   - Component-based architecture
   - Separation of UI components and business logic
   - Feature-based organization within apps

The directory structure will be:

```
apps/
├── web/                # Next.js web application
│   ├── app/            # Next.js app router
│   └── styles/         # Web-specific styles
│
├── native/             # React Native mobile application
│   ├── app/            # Expo router
│   └── assets/         # Mobile-specific assets
│
packages/
├── ui/                 # Shared UI components
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/ # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── hooks/      # Shared hooks
│   │   ├── theme/      # Theme configuration
│   │   └── utils/      # Utility functions
│   └── tsconfig.json   # TypeScript configuration
│
└── typescript-config/  # Shared TypeScript configurations
    ├── base.json       # Base TypeScript configuration
    ├── nextjs.json     # Next.js specific configuration
    └── react-native-library.json # React Native specific configuration
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Code Sharing**: Maximizes code reuse between web and mobile
- **Consistent UX**: Shared UI components ensure consistent user experience
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides strong typing across the codebase
- **Developer Experience**: Unified development experience for web and mobile
- **Maintainability**: Shared components reduce duplication and maintenance burden

### Negative

- **Performance Considerations**: React Native Web adds some overhead compared to pure web frameworks
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Some features may still require platform-specific implementations
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand both web and mobile development paradigms
- **Build Complexity**: More complex build configuration for supporting multiple platforms

## Alternatives Considered

### Separate Codebases for Web and Mobile

- **Pros**: Optimized for each platform, simpler platform-specific builds
- **Cons**: Code duplication, inconsistent UX, higher maintenance burden

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Only

- **Pros**: Single codebase, simpler development
- **Cons**: Limited access to native features, potentially inferior mobile experience

### Flutter

- **Pros**: True cross-platform with a single codebase, good performance
- **Cons**: Different language (Dart), smaller ecosystem, less web-optimized
