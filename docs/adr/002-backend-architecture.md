# ADR-002: Backend Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design a backend architecture for the ColorAgent application that is scalable, maintainable, and follows modern best practices. The backend needs to:

- Provide a RESTful API for the frontend applications
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Interact with a database
- Process background tasks
- Be easily testable and maintainable

## Decision

We will use FastAPI as our backend framework with the following architecture:

1. **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance, async-first API development
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy as the ORM
3. **Caching**: Redis for caching and session management
4. **Background Tasks**: Celery for handling asynchronous tasks
5. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
6. **Logging**: Structured logging with structlog
7. **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with separation of concerns:
   - Models: Database models using SQLAlchemy
   - Schemas: Data validation and serialization using Pydantic
   - Services: Business logic
   - API: Route definitions and controllers
   - Core: Application configuration and shared utilities

The directory structure will be:

```
apps/api/
├── src/
│   ├── api/            # API routes and controllers
│   ├── core/           # Core functionality (config, security, etc.)
│   ├── models/         # Database models
│   ├── schemas/        # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── services/       # Business logic
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
├── tests/              # Tests
└── pyproject.toml      # Project configuration
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: FastAPI provides high performance with async support
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic provides runtime type checking and validation
- **Documentation**: Automatic API documentation with OpenAPI
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with the layered architecture
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: Async-first approach allows for better resource utilization

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn FastAPI and async Python
- **Complexity**: More complex architecture compared to simpler frameworks
- **Boilerplate**: More initial setup required for the layered architecture

## Alternatives Considered

### Flask with Flask-RESTful

- **Pros**: Simpler, more familiar to many Python developers
- **Cons**: Synchronous by default, less performant, less built-in type safety

### Django REST Framework

- **Pros**: Batteries-included, strong ORM, admin interface
- **Cons**: Heavier, synchronous by default, less flexible for custom architectures

### NestJS (Node.js)

- **Pros**: Similar architecture to Angular, strong TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Different language ecosystem, would require separate team skills
