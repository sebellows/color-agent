# 4. Docker Containerization

Date: 2025-05-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Color-Agent monorepo contains multiple applications (backend API, web frontend, and mobile app) along with shared packages. As the project grows, we need a consistent and reliable way to:

1. Set up development environments quickly
2. Ensure consistent behavior across different development machines
3. Simplify deployment to various environments
4. Enable CI/CD pipelines with reliable testing
5. Scale individual services independently

## Decision

We will containerize the applications using Docker with the following approach:

1. Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for each application:

    - Backend API (FastAPI)
    - Web frontend (Next.js)

2. Use Docker Compose for local development:

    - Set up a development environment with all necessary services
    - Enable hot reloading for development
    - Configure appropriate volumes for code changes

3. Leverage Turborepo's pruning capabilities:

    - Use `turbo prune` to create minimal Docker contexts
    - Optimize build times and image sizes

4. Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

    - Build and test Docker images
    - Push to container registry
    - Run integration tests in containerized environments

5. Configure environment-specific settings:
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Production

## Consequences

### Positive

-   Consistent development environment across team members
-   Simplified onboarding for new developers
-   Reliable testing in CI/CD pipelines
-   Easier deployment to various environments
-   Better isolation between services
-   Ability to scale services independently
-   Improved build performance with Turborepo caching

### Negative

-   Additional complexity in the build process
-   Learning curve for team members not familiar with Docker
-   Potential for increased resource usage in development
-   Need to manage Docker-specific configurations

### Mitigations

-   Provide comprehensive documentation in DOCKER.md
-   Create helper scripts for common Docker operations
-   Optimize Docker configurations for development experience
-   Implement proper caching strategies to improve build times
